@book{Montgomery.2015,
 abstract = {Praise for the First Edition '...[t]he book is great for readers who need to apply the methods and models presented but have little background in mathematics and statistics.' -MAA Reviews Thoroughly updated throughout, Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Second Editionpresents the underlying theories of time series analysis that are needed to analyze time-oriented data and construct real-world short- to medium-term statistical forecasts.    Authored by highly-experienced academics and professionals in engineering statistics, the Second Editionfeatures discussions on both popular and modern time series methodologies as well as an introduction to Bayesian methods in forecasting. Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Second Editionalso includes: Over 300 exercises from diverse disciplines including health care, environmental studies, engineering, and financeMore than 50 programming algorithms using JMP{\circledR}, SAS{\circledR}, and R that illustrate the theory and practicality of forecasting techniques in the context of time-oriented data New material  on frequency domain and spatial temporal data analysisExpanded coverage of the variogram and spectrum with applications as well as transfer and intervention model functionsA supplementary website featuring  PowerPoint{\circledR} slides, data sets, and select solutions to the problems Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, Second Editionis an ideal textbook upper-undergraduate and graduate-levels courses in forecasting and time series. The book is also an excellent reference for practitioners and researchers who need to model and analyze time series data to generate forecasts. Douglas C. Montgomery, PhD,is Regents' Professor and ADU Foundation Professor of Engineering at Arizona State University. With over 35 years of academic and consulting experience, Dr. Montgomery has authored or coauthored over 250 journal articles and 13 books. His research interests include design and analysis of experiments, statistical methods for process monitoring and optimization, and the analysis of time-oriented data. Cheryl L. Jennings, PhD,is a Process Design Consultant with Bank of America. An active member of both the American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality, her areas of research and profession interest include Six Sigma, modeling and analysis, and process control and improvement.

@book{Walker.2024,
 abstract = {Jumping into data analysis without proper data cleaning will certainly lead to incorrect results. The Python Data Cleaning Cookbook - Second Edition will show you tools and techniques for cleaning and handling data with Python for better outcomes. Fully updated to the latest version of Python and all relevant tools, this book will teach you how to manipulate and clean data to get it into a useful form. he current edition focuses on advanced techniques like machine learning and AI-specific approaches and tools for data cleaning along with the conventional ones. The book also delves into tips and techniques to process and clean data for ML, AI, and NLP models. You will learn how to filter and summarize data to gain insights and better understand what makes sense and what does not, along with discovering how to operate on data to address the issues you've identified. Next, you'll cover recipes for using supervised learning and Naive Bayes analysis to identify unexpected values and classification errors and generate visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify unexpected values. Finally, you'll build functions and classes that you can reuse without modification when you have new data. By the end of this Data Cleaning book, you'll know how to clean data and diagnose problems within it.},

 abstract = {Feature engineering is a crucial step in the machine-learning pipeline, yet this topic is rarely examined on its own. With this practical book, youll learn techniques for extracting and transforming featuresthe numeric representations of raw datainto formats for machine-learning models. Each chapter guides you through a single data problem, such as how to represent text or image data. Together, these examples illustrate the main principles of feature engineering.--},
